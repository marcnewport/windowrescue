            p Restrictor stays provide security and prevent small children falling out of windows. Council regulations require restrictor stays to be installed on all windows below 760mm from the floor or in the bathroom windows above baths or toilets. Windows in these situations are only to open 100mm.

            h3 My Sliding Door Is Really Hard To Close
            p This is often due to wheels seizing through lack of maintenance. A useful solution is to purchase a penetrating oil and water-displacing spray from a local hardware store. Spray around the wheels, this should allow the wheels to roll more freely. This product is also useful in the maintenance of door hinges, preventing rust and reducing squeaks.

            h3 Discolouring And Fading Powder Coated Windows
            p To prevent this happening the outside of windows and doors should be cleaned with a soft cloth and mild liquid detergent in warm water and then rinsed with cold clean water on a regular basis. We suggest this is done at least 6 monthly and more often if you live closer to the sea.
